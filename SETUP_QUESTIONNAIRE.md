## What Gandalf Wants to Know

### 1. The Project
- What's the project called?
- One-line description of what it does
- What repos will the Fellowship work in? (directory name, purpose, tech stack for each)

### 2. Commands & Workflow
- Key commands per repo (dev, build, test, lint, migrate)
- Default branch (main, develop, etc.)
- Feature branch naming format
- PR title format
- Merge strategy (squash, merge commits, rebase)

### 3. Architecture & Tools
- Project management tool (GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, Notion, or none)
  - Issue ID format and status flow if applicable
- Auth approach (JWT, sessions, OAuth2, etc.)
- API style (REST, GraphQL, tRPC)
- Key conventions ("money in cents", "feature flags via X", etc.)

### 4. Infra & Specialist Domain
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, etc.)
- Cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Vercel)
- Environments (dev → staging → production)
- Specialized domain for Pippin? (smart contracts, ML, mobile, data engineering, or none)
  - If yes: tools, frameworks, and special considerations

### 5. Team Preferences (optional)
- Code review requirements (approvals needed)
- Sensitive areas the Fellowship should never auto-modify
- Anything else

## Shortcut: Paste Everything at Once

If you'd rather skip the conversation and give Gandalf everything up front, just paste your answers in a single message after `/setup-fellowship`. Gandalf will parse them and go straight to calibration. Free-form is fine — no special format required.
