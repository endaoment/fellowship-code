# /deploy-and-release

Release merged PRs to production.

## Phase Intent

This phase handles the full release lifecycle: release candidate PRs, CI monitoring, QA verification, staging, and production deployment. Human checkpoints apply at QA approval and pipeline approvals.

> **Customize this phase** for your deployment pipeline. If you have a release-manager agent, this phase wraps it. Otherwise, Gandalf coordinates the release directly.

## Constraints

1. NEVER skip human checkpoints -- QA approval required before production.
2. NEVER deploy without CI green on the release branch.
3. If the release process stalls, escalate to the user.

## Workers

| Worker  | `subagent_type`    | Mission                               |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Gandalf | (orchestrator)     | Coordinate the release                |
| Smeagol | `smeagol-the-pm`  | QA issue creation and tracking        |

> **Tip**: If your project has a dedicated release-manager agent, add it here as the primary worker and make this phase a thin wrapper.

## Done Criteria

Complete when: production is deployed and a report has been delivered to the user.
